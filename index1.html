            <p>Since the service <strong>RoutePlanner</strong> is a web application, all that is needed - is to connect to the
                Internet to address counterparty information about the fleet and order information - everything else the
                service will do for you. We have developed the most simple and user-friendly interface. Even complex
                operations are performed in "two clicks".<strong> Route calculation takes only 10-15 seconds.</strong> Therefore, you can
                easily plan graphs hydrating for many days to come.</p>
