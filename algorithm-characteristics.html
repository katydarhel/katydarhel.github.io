        <p> We do not use <strong>genetic algorithms</strong> that give acceptable results after working quite a lot of time, it is
            necessary to understand that such decisions, due to their very nature, can never build enough optimal routes, if not
            worked for a long time (10 minutes). Although it should be noted that to solve small problems (up to 100 orders), such
            decision will give good results in short time.</p>

        <p>Our innovative algorithm for calculating a "know-how" of our company and faster than the any other solutions. For
            example, to route orders in <strong>2000</strong> and a fleet of <strong>200</strong> vehicles, taking into account
            all possible restrictions will be counted and is optimized for approximately <strong>40 seconds</strong>, 1000 orders and 100
            vehicles - about 10 seconds.</p>

        <p>Such indicators allow speed quickly recalculates the route if you change any of the characteristics calculation (add the order,
            the car was in the repair, new "desired delivery windows" and so on). And makes the manual planning ineffective and even
            harmful. Our experience in implementing fully proved the thesis.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #6197b8;">SOME OF THE CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OF CALCULATION:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Limitations of traffic (one-way traffic, turn restrictions, etc.)</li>
            <li>Traffic jams statistics</li>
            <li>Speed on various types of roads</li>
            <li>Desired delivery window</li>
            <li>VIP-client - so the order is delivered to customers in the first place</li>
            <li>Service intervals and schedule point of discharge (eg, from 8:00 to 12:00 planned discharge time of 15 minutes,
                from 12:00 to 19:00 - 45 minutes of intervals can be any number, which makes it very flexible to take into account
                the time nuances)
            </li>
            <li>Accounting for body-weight characteristics of transport and cargo</li>
            <li>Congestion control</li>
            <li>Control compatibility goods</li>
            <li>Control of the possibility of adopting a specific counterparty-duty machines</li>
            <li>Accounting desired geozones on your routes for each driver</li>
            <li>Accounting for the maximum number of points in the route</li>
            <li>Time management of the warehouse or distribution center (point of loading)</li>
            <li>Given the long working hours of the driver</li>
            <li>Accounting for tariff zones</li>
            <li>Accounting gaps in certain areas for each driver</li>
        </ul>
